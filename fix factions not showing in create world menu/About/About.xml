  <description>Load this after faction mods. 
Fixes some modded factions not appearing in world creation menu by adding maxConfigurableAtWorldCreation to their factiondef. 

Doesn't affect factions that already have maxConfigurableAtWorldCreation.
Doesn't affect hidden factions.
Doesn't affect player factions.
Doesn't affect abstract bases.
Doesn't affect factions based on abstract bases other than FactionBase.

Due to the restrictions it is extremely unlikely to cause any issues and in my testing still covers most modded factions that require the fix. If you have this mod installed and some factions are still hidden, link me the mod which adds those factions.

An xml patch operation that doesn't replace anything so will be compatible with every mod.</description>
