Load this after faction mods. 
Fixes some modded factions not appearing in world creation menu by adding maxConfigurableAtWorldCreation to their factiondef. Doesn't affect factions that already have it.

purely xml patch operation that doesn't replace anything so will be compatible with every mod.
