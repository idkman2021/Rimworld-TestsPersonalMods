Mod | Description
------------ | -------------
**fix factions not showing in create world menu** | A patch operation that automatically fixes most modded factions not appearing in world creation menu by adding maxConfigurableAtWorldCreation to their factiondef.
**HAR thoughtSettings Remover** | A patch operation that automatically removes all thoughtSettings from all HAR races loaded before it. Useful if you want to make HAR races closer to humans and less OP and might also improve performance.
**HAR Research Restrictions Remover** | A patch operation that automatically removes all research restrictions from all HAR races loaded before it. Useful if you have mods like Random Research.
**BG - Uniform** | Replaces core rimworld background with uniform rimworld UI color.
**TQuality** | Quality now affects all stats, including cooldown and most miscellaneous stats. Awful items are now worse and legendary - better. Other qualities have only slightly stronger scaling and remain close to vanilla. This mod affects armor, weapons and tools, shield belts.

### Other fixes:
**nerubians fix** - A patch operation that automatically fixes a bug in https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2148383162 where you can't equip some vanilla weapons with any races other than nerubians. Also removes all weapon restrictions from them because they didn't make sense
