  <description>Adds Punchy from starbound for testing purposes. The main variant is impossible to miss, has a single bodypart and exactly 10000 health so you can easily compare DPS. There are also different variants for different testing purposes - different sizes, different armor values.

A gun that does exactly 100 dps - 100 damage and 1 shot per second with maximum accuracy. Stuffable and quality variants of the gun. Same for a melee and an explosive weapon. Useful for testing infusions, stuff materials, qualities, etc.


They are only obtainable through devmode, although I can't guarantee rimworld won't try to sneak something in a quest, especially in a modded one.</description>
