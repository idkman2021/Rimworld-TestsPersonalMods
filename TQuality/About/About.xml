	<description>Quality now affects all stats, including cooldown and most miscellaneous stats. Awful items are now worse and legendary - better. Other qualities have only slightly stronger scaling and remain close to vanilla.
This mod affects armor, weapons and tools, shield belts.


This mod is based on Santakat's Improved Quality Scaling, but the scaling is not as strong as in santakat's mod; and Phlivan.WontDieInNoob's Quality Matters, with scaling slightly stronger than in Phlivan.WontDieInNoob's mod.
