  <description>Automatically removes all thoughtSettings from all Humanoid Alien Races mods that are loaded before this mod. 

The thoughtSettings are used to customize what thoughts the race can and can't get.

I've noticed that modders love to make their races not care about living in barracks, death, etc, which I found unbalanced.
I've also noticed a pretty bad harmony patch that HAR creates because of those thoughtSettings.

By removing thoughtSettings this mod potentially makes races more balanced. It also potentially reduces the lag but I don't know if it actually does or not.

If you want a certain race mod to not be affected, load it after this mod.

Note! Vert rarely race mods might start to show red errors tring to reference the removed xml note. Those errors are harmless.</description>
